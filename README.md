# Memory-game

The memory game will test your photogenic memory. 
This is a time when games were mean't to be enjoyed, Arcade style. 

JavaScript is the preferred coding language used for this game.

The coding concepts used were as follows:
...................................................................
.append()
.createElement()
.getAttribute()
.length
.Math.random()
.push()
.querySelector()
.querySelectorAll()
.removeEventListener()
.setAttribute()
.textContent
alert()
setTimeout()
...................................................................

Game components:
The game components that were considered within the functionality include:
-Board
-Check for match
-Flip card

How it works:
Remember the duo at all times. 

1. The player will need to flip the board to find matching pairs of pictures. 

Launch:
Simply use Visual Studio Code or any HTML/JS/CSS compatible IDE(Integrated development environment) of your choice. 

The code was originally constructed by Ania Kub√≥w of Free code camp. This is used as a basepoint for future adaptions that I aim to make of this game.
